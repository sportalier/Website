    <h1> Research Interest </h1>
    <p> I have a broad interest in Community Ecology. I try to figure out 
    how natural communities are structured and how they evolve. More specifically, 
    I investigate constraints on trophic relationships and how they influence the structure 
    of food webs. This constraints can either be biotic or abiotic. The surrounding medium 
    plays a fundamental and often neglected role on community structure. The physical factors
    characterizing the medium (such as gravity, density or viscosity) as well as chemical 
    factors (such as nutrient availability) play a fundamental role
    in species persistence and species interactions. </p> 
    <!-- <p> I also investigate the relative effects of top-down versus bottom-up constraints on 
    species coexistence and competition. Again, the surrounding medium plays a role in term
    of resource availability (such as chemical elements). Last, parasites are known to be 
    present in all ecosystems. Thus, their influence should be taken into consideration. </p> 
    <p> One should not neglect the role of body size.--> 
    <p> I also study the role of body size as an interface between species and the medium. 
    As body size is related to many biological rates, it constrains 
    species interactions. </p>
    <p> My works implies use of mathematical models in order to investigate these factors and 
    their effects on community structure. </p>
